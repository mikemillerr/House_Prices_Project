# House_Prices_Project

This project is centered around exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and statistical analysis, as well as modeling data using linear regression. Goal of this project is to run through the entire Data Science Life Cycle and become familiar with all steps:
- Data Mining
- Data Cleaning
- Data Exploration
- Data Visualization
- Data Modeling
- Model Evaluation

To present our findings a business presentation was held. To show our work more indept the notebooks were presented afterward to the class.

The timebox for this project was 10 hours.

## The Dataset
The project uses the King County House Sales dataset. King County is situated around Seatle in the North West of the United States in the state of Washington. It contains about 21500 entries of houses sold in the years 2014-2015. Further description of the dataset can be found in "column_names.md" or in notebook part_1.


## What is the goal of this project?
This project summarizes the topics learned in the first couple of days of the bootcamp. The focus is on Exploratory Data Analysis and fitting of linear regression model. The dataset is not split into train and testset. So no prediction are done. Main objective was to create a model with an R2-score in the range of 0.75 - 0.9 without obvious overfit.
    
Additionally three different business strategies had to be defined and answer:
1. How can the house price when selling a house be maximized?
2. Are there other strategies on maximizing house prices?
3. What is the best time to buy and sell houses?
    
## How is this repository structures?
There are three different ipython notebooks which contain all code and visualizations:

### The Code:
- Part_1:
    - Data Mining
    - Data Cleaning
        - Missing Data
        - Datatype adjustment
        - Feature Engineering
        - Transformation of Categorical Data
    - Data Visualization
    
- Part_2:
    - Visualization of Correlations
    - Simple Linear Regression
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - The Final Model
    
- Part_3:
    - Answering of the stated business questions
    - Visualization to make the case
    
### The Presentation:
In directory presentation a pdf of a given business presentation can be found it. There is a transcript of the presentation can in the notes. The time box of the business presentation was 5 minutes.
