# House_Prices_Project

This project is centered around exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and statistical analysis, as well as modeling data using linear regression. Goal of this project is to run through the entire Data Science Life Cycle and become familiar with all steps:
- Data Mining
- Data Cleaning
- Data Exploration
- Data Visualization
- Data Modeling
- Model Evaluation

## The Dataset
The project uses the King County House Sales dataset. King County is situated around Seatle in the North West of the United States in the state of Washington. It contains about 21500 entries of houses sold in the years 2014-2015. Further description of the dataset can be found in "column_names.md" or in notebook part_1.


## What is the goal of this project?
This project summearizes the topics learned in the first couple of days of the bootcamp. The focus is on Exploratory Data Analysis and fitting of linear regression model. The dataset is not split into train and testset. So no prediction are done. Main objective was to create a model with an R2-score in the range of 0.75 - 0.9 without obvious overfit.
    
Additionally three different business strategies had to be defined and answer:
    - How can the house price when selling a house be maximized?
    - Are there other strategies on maximizing house prices?
    - What is the best time to buy and sell houses?
    
## How is this repository structures?

There are three different ipython notebooks which contain all code and visualizations:
    - 

- Explain the goal
  - Business Strategies
- How is the repo structured?
  - Part 1
  - Part 2
  - Part 3
- Presentation

The Data Science Life Cycle goals for this project include: Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization and Predictive Modeling (by linear regression).

All parts of the data analysis are documented in the notebook “House_Prices_Project_Karima.ipynb” and include the following steps:

    Load Packages and Dataset

    Data Cleaning:
        Data types (deals with conversion of data types)
        Missing data (handles missing values)

    Data Exploration & Visualization
        Overview of all features (using scatter_matrix plots)
        Exploring features one by one (histograms, pie/bar charts, scatter/regression plots)
        Correlation analysis (heatmaps)
        Folium map (mean price per zipcode)

    Multiple Regression Model
        Model fitting and summary statistics
        Multicollinearity (checking variance inflation factors)
